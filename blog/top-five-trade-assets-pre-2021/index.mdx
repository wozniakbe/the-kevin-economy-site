# Totally Accurate: Top 5 Trade Assets in The Kevin
In another installment of Totally Accurateâ„¢ predictions by yours truly, I'd like to talk about the Top 5 trade assets in The Kevin. I have been trying to grade players in terms of their value to the league, and a lot of things are still uncertain to me. What is a draft pick worth? What is salary space worth? What is a roster spot worth? It's going to take at least a few seasons to really get a grip on this stuff, and even by then, things change. In the end, I landed on some half-answers to the questions above that should help explain a bit of my rating process.

## What is a draft pick worth?
Really, who knows. If it helps, I think JaMarr Chase should have been the 1.1 selection in this year's draft, followed by Najee Harris. You can argue Lawrence number 1 but the bust rate on quarterbacks is a bit higher, even for a 1.1 selection. Will gave up a future 2nd rounder for 2 years of a (hopefully) healthy Cam Akers. Keep in mind Akers is likely paid below market value if he does return healthy. Ben gave up a 3rd rounder for AmonRa St. Brown, who I'd have pegged as a 2nd round pick or possibly a 3rd round in this past year's draft. And the most interesting trade of them all, Jake gave up a 2nd round pick for Jordan Love, who could become an absolute steal at QB if he is even an average QB2 over the next 5 years. Basically, we don't know, but I have 28 players valued greater than or equal to the value of a top 4 draft pick (assuming you don't know if it will be any of 1-4).

## What is salary space worth?
Oh boy. Another question I can't answer. Really, I have no quantitative answer to give. All of the guys I'm about to mention are overpaid by my estimates, but if you overpay to win a championship, well, those live forever.

## What is a roster spot worth?
I think this one isn't cut and dry but also is a bit easier to answer. Everyone loves the 2-for-1 or even 3-for-1 "but you get so many quality guys!!" trade proposal, but fail to recognize that acquiring 3 players also means losing 2 of your current ones. Chances are the guys being cut are of lesser value than those being acquired. I'd probably tack on 20% "value" inflation if there is a second player involved, and start moving up 10% from there. Again, all the numbers are made up and don't matter, but we need to start somewhere.

Alright, enough of that nonsense. Before I get started, I need to layout some assumptions made in evaluating players and their value.

1. This assumes that both teams in any hypothetical trade have a reasonable shot to win this season. Not rebuilders, not powerhouse title favorites.
1. This assumes the players are on "ideal" contract values. I have ideal contract values for players, you might have different ones. I'm not going to explicitly share these values, but assume the guys are making what you think they're worth.
1. This isn't exact, but I'd say I am rating current production vs future potential about 70/30. You're in the hunt this season, so you need production now. However, this IS dynasty, so we won't be seeing older stars like Tom Brady show up on this list.
1. All trade values are theoretically 1-for-1. Spoiler alert into how I judge some trades, but the more guys tacked on the acquire one player, the more you'll need to pay up, as roster spaces do have some inherent value.

Confusing enough? Let's get started.

### 5. QB Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills
There's a lot of debate early on whether QBs are as overpowered as our auction salaries indicate. Allen hasn't produced much yet this season, but he monster 2020 shows the potential he has in an offense designed around his strengths. In a SuperFlex league, having 2 solid QBs feels like an unavoidable strategy. If you're starting with Allen, you're likely getting a QB1 performance almost each week. His floor as a rushing QB is well-established, rushing for 8+ TDs in each of his first three seasons in the league.

Add in the giant contract Allen signed, and you know you are getting a strong starting QB for basically as long as you're willing to pay for it. I don't love his $570 salary in our league, which caps his current and future value a bit lower than I'm getting at here. I still think that if Josh hits Free Agency in 2 years once his deal is up, he'd end up back on this list, maybe with an even cheaper contract.

### 4. RB Dalvin Cook, Minnesota Vikings
Running Backs are the premium currency of fantasy football these days, as it becomes harder each year to find a true bellcow back in the running and passing game. Dalvin Cook is both of these things, rushing for over 1,000 yards each of the last two seasons and catching at least 40 balls in the last three. The Vikings love to run the ball, and Cook is their guy.

The Vikings do have an aging roster and the defense isn't what it once was. If the team turns the keys over to Kellen Mond in the next couple years, I don't think their offensive philosophy changes much. If the team finds itself down early and often, that could hurt Cook's touches in the running game. I still think he does enough as a receiver and a constant threat to run even when down that he should see this type of production continue for at least a few more years. Cook might have the fastest drop-off of anyone on this list, but for the next few years, I see him as a top-5 asset in dynasty.

### 3. QB Kyler Murray, Arizona Cardinals
Kyler started the year #10 on my list and has been boosted to #3 after his hot start to the year. I have concerns about Kingsbury as an offensive coach in the NFL, but his strategy of running-and-gunning with a simple playbook is once again working to start the year. The Cardinals apparently run a limited route tree (something I admittedly did not know anything about coming into the season) which could really start to bite this team as the year goes on and defenses have ample film to adjust against. However, I don't know how much it matters for Kyler's production. Consider this year's first two games, where Kyler ran the ball a combined 10 times and gained a total of 17 fantasy points. The dude just gets yards and is hard to keep out of the end zone. If defenses adjust to the Arizona passing game, they might have to readjust if Kyler starts keeping the ball on the ground more frequently.

The Cardinals have also continued to invest in weapons for Murray, most recently 2nd round WR Rondale Moore (a personal favorite of mine and bound to end up in an article in the near future). Throwing to DeAndre Hopkins, AJ Green, Christian Kirk, and Rondale Moore on the outside only allows a defense to cover so much. They also need to worry about one of the fastest players in the NFL scrambling, Murray himself. Minus AJ Green, this setup is probably in place for the next few years. I'm probably not paying Kyler over 20% of the cap, but at a more reasonable number, he's challenging his way into the best dynasty asset at the QB position, and maybe all of football.

### 2. RB Christian McCaffrey, Carolina Panthers
The best all-around back in the NFL, McCaffrey nearly grabs the top spot in the Trade Assets rankings. And maybe he should get #1. There just aren't RBs these days who get 15-20 touches in the running game and can still turn around to catch 5-10 balls each week. Sam Darnold has shown life as an actual NFL QB this season, which could boost McCaffrey's production even further. Would you believe me if I said the Carolina Panthers have the highest team DVOA in the NFL after week 2? It's true. McCaffrey doesn't exactly stand out as someone who racks up garbage time touches, but if the Panthers end up leading games late this year, McCaffrey is bound to be at the upper bound of 15-20 carries and 5-10 catches each week. You just can't put a high enough premium on that many touches.

With a lot of touches comes a lot of wear and tear. McCaffrey, of course, missed 13+ games last year between a high ankle sprain and a separated shoulder. This is the first bout of missed time in his career, so time will tell if he has the build to stand up to a new 17 game season. I can't bring myself to dock him too much after one season, so he still lands in the #2 spot. He's only 25 years old, which reasonably could give another 4-5 years of prime McCaffrey. Even if you told me I get a guaranteed 3 years of the best RB in football, sign me up.

### 1. QB Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs
This freakin guy. Patrick Mahomes is magical. I can't watch Chiefs football games the same as other games anymore because I just know it won't end up making sense. Mahomes is the best QB in the league on one of the best teams in the league, with the best TE in the league, and arguably the best WR in the league. It doesn't get much better than this. Not to mention that QBs age more gracefully than ever, Mahomes may hold this spot for 5+ years and no one should be surprised. You can argue that his lack of a true running game hurts his floor more than QBs like Kyler and Lamar, and maybe even Trey Lance in the future. When he throws as much and as well as he does, however, I don't think any of this matters.

After taking a beating in the Super Bowl last year, the Chiefs invested in young, solid offensive lineman to keep their franchise QB upright. Orlando Brown Jr (25), Joe Thuney (28), Creed Humphrey (22), Trey Smith (22), and Lucas Niang (23) hold down the line, and could continue to do so for years to come. Offensive line continuity will continue to help this team, and I don't see a scenario where Mahomes production drops off anytime soon.

And there you have it. Not necessarily a groundbreaking list or any crazy points made here. I think what I took away from this is that the way I am currently valuing players is to not overthink it too much. A lot of my value in a player is what he can do for me right now. Yes, it's a dynasty league, but $10/win and winning a championship can set you up for years to come. I'm sure there are arguments to be made that value is what wins championships, and I would love to hear some of those differing opinions. Until we crown our first champion, the jury is still out. Thanks if you made it this far reading.
