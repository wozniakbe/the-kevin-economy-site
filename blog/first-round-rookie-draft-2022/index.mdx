One month after Free Agency, and no mention of it on this site. I'll get to some of that eventually, but we already have another draft to talk about!
The inaugural Kevin Dynasty League Rookie Draft kicked off with much anticipation at 12am Central Time on the 11th.

For draft grades, I want to try and give a bit more transparency where the grades are coming from.
At the end of the day they're still subject to my bias and whatever I decide, but hopefully this helps define what an A, B, C, etc are.

## Trade Grade Explanations
When it comes to rookie draft picks, there's two parts I think we can evaluate.
There's always the present year, technically the most valuable year.
A draft pick who will have immediate fantasy impact like Breece Hall naturally is valued beyond, say, a Trey Lance type drafted based upon potential.

Being a dynasty league, there's also the future element that can provide value to a player's stock.
Some players may not put up impressive numbers their rookie seasons, but there's clearly potential that you can bank on for the following ones.
There are varying reasons for this, whether it be a rookie QB sitting behind a veteran, a TE simply figuring out a complex position, or other factors like injuries.

Beyond these two factors, there's also the monetary element to everything we do in a salary cap league.
The fixed draft scale that gradually decreases adds an interesting twist to the careers of the players selected at their respective slots.
Obviously Breece Hall will be going first overall, but Breece Hall making $150 is way different than Breece Hall making $97.
This doesn't have much to do with the decision to draft a player, since GM's can't just defer to a lower, and cheaper, draft slot.
However, it may affect which positions get targeted early on, as the risk of a 3 year contract making a high first-rounder's salary definitely needs to be taken into consideration.

### The Projections
The projected dollar amounts that I'm going to attach to each pick is the combined ESPN/Yahoo projections for a player turned into dollars.
I pulled these numbers a bit over a month ago so some players may have changed slightly, but most rookies haven't had drastic changes in environment since then.
The dollars calculated use the same method that all other dollars on this site come from, essentially giving dollars of production for points scored over replacement.
For rookies, this is far from the only factor to grade a pick's success, but it definitely is a factor for immediate impact.

### The Grading Scale 
**A**: Any A-grade given out represents a major success in both of the factors mentioned above, present and future. 

**B**: A B-grade represents a clear win in one of the factors, possibly with the sacrifice of another. Specifically, a contending roster passing up an opportunity to add in an area of need. 

**C**: Giving out a C isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it means I didn't love the pick for any particular reason. Maybe a rebuilding team drafts a risky prospect too high, committing too much salary. 

**D/F**: I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.

## First Round Reactions
#### 1.01 - Breece Hall (Team Estelle)
##### Position: RB 
##### Base Salary: $150
##### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $177

We all knew it was going to happen. No matter how much Nick and Eddie tried talking this out of existence, Breece was always going first overall.
For Tony, it was a no-brainer. Easily the best fantasy asset coming out of the draft, this gives Team Estelle a foundational RB to build around.

As a quick spin zone, would it be crazy to suggest that trading Breece Hall immediately would net the highest value? Is the "idea" of Breece Hall better than the actual product?
We'll see, but even with his $150 salary, this is a great pick and a great player.

##### The Grade: A 
----
#### 1.02 - Ken Walker (Dayman & The Nightman)
##### Position: RB 
##### Base Salary: $147
##### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $80

Hardly a shocker, Nick and Eddie opt to go with the second best running back in the draft in Ken Walker.
After waiting 17 hours for the selection, we got some timely information from the Sleeper app that Pete Carroll is "comfortable" with Walker as a three-down back.
In a rush heavy offense, Walker definitely has a shot at beating his $80 projection this year, which assumes an even split with Rashaad Penny.
As for future years, it's easy to see Walker carving out a role as an impact fantasy RB.

##### The Grade: A 
----
#### 1.03 - Drake London (Tuna Fish)
##### Position: WR
##### Base Salary: $144
##### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $90

The first WR off the board was, again, not a shocker. Al and Chuck didn't have much choice other than to take the best WR at this point.
Adding London to a WR room that already includes guys like DeVonta Smith, JuJu Smith-Schuster, and Christian Kirk, this lineup is starting to round out.
London should be a top dynasty asset for years to come, but I think he has a really good shot to outperform his $90 projection by a longshot.
The only negative here might be that this starts a run on WRs who aren't separated by much. London automatically becomes the highest paid of the bunch.

##### The Grade: A-
----
#### 1.04 - Garrett Wilson (Poopy Ass Dolla)
##### Position: WR
##### Base Salary: $141
##### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $84

In Danny J's better move of the night, he selected Garrett Wilson, another solid pick.
These draft grades might get a little monotonous, but there isn't a lot separating the top of this draft class.
Danny's team appears to be in rebuild mode when you look at the roster, and he just needs to keep adding talented players.

##### The Grade: A-
----
### TRADE ALERT
Rumors were swirling that Jake was shopping the 5th overall pick, and separate rumors were teasing an imminent trade.
Could they be tied together?

NO! In a blockbuster move, the Danny's teamed up to make a trade that will impact the league for years to come.

#### Poopy Ass Dolla receives:
| Player | POS | Contract | Yrs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Elijah Mitchell | RB | $85 | 2 |
| 2024 2nd | - | - | 3 |

#### Nosmo King receives:
| Player | POS | Contract | Yrs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2023 1st | - | - | 3+1 |
| KJ Hamler | WR | $7 | 4 |

Oh my. Obviously, this trade heavily hinges on the performance of Poopy Ass Dolla during the 2022 season.
I've been very wrong about teams before, but I just don't see it. Even after adding Elijah Mitchell, it's an uphill battle for this team to become competitive.
Mitchell certainly helps, as does playing in a division with Team Estelle (sorry Tony). Maybe Justin Fields breaks out this year and Kirk Cousins puts up a Good Kirk year.
However, I'd say it's more likely this is a top 3 pick than it is a playoff team pick.

The benefit for Danny B is a potential franchise cornerstone player. The 2023 draft is apparently loaded, and this pick is going to net a very solid player.
Losing Elijah Mitchell hurts his thin RB room, but it's not totally barren, rostering Antonio Gibson, Kareem Hunt, and Tony Pollard.
KJ Hamler on a $7 contract is actually a pretty nice sleeper/bench player, especially with the injury Tim Patrick sustained.
This one may not age well, folks.

#### Grade
**Danny J: F**  
**Danny B: A** 

Moving on.

#### 1.05 - Treylon Burks (Monks of Vegas)
##### Position: WR
##### Base Salary: $136
##### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $96

Treylon Burks is ESPN's highest projected rookie WR for 2022, and the Titans seemed to like him enough to trade AJ Brown away to the Eagles.
It sounds like Treylon Burks's biggest enemy is going to be himself.
Reports from camp include him being out of shape, not remembering routes, and being plagued by drops.
Plagued by drops in training camp...does that ring a bell for anyone else?

No, I'm not saying Burks is poised to be the next JaMarr Chase. I'm just saying we should reserve some judgement until we see this guy play an actual NFL game.
Salaries start decreasing more heavily at the 5th pick, and I definitely like Burks with a lower salary especially due to his risk.
The move also plays very nicely for this season, as Jake lacks a true #2 receiver behind Davante Adams. Could Burks fill that role?

##### The Grade: A-
----
#### 1.06 - Jameson Williams (Drive-Thru Open Late)
##### Position: WR
##### Base Salary: $131
##### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $52

Jesus Christ Ben, stop giving out A grades to everyone. Why are you even writing this article?

Okay, fine, I'll get critical for myself then. I obviously love this pick, because I made it! But how does it stack up to the grading criteria?

On the surface, it's a bad move for this season. This team is already heavy on WR, still added Deebo Samuel in Free Agency, and now adds Williams?
There are more glaring current and future needs at QB and RB, so why go with Williams?

Answer: his potential is sky-high. I really think that had Williams not torn his ACL, he would be a top 3 pick in this draft without a doubt.
Unfortunately, he *did* tear his ACL, so that's a factor that cannot be ignored. There's huge future upside here, but it comes with a lot of risk.

##### The Grade: B
----
#### 1.07 - Chris Olave (Bangin' Dirty Coors)
##### Position: WR
##### Base Salary: $126
##### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $74

Simply put, the Saints gave up a haul of draft capital to acquire Olave.
I'm not an NFL GM (*really???*), so I'm going to trust the guys who get paid millions of dollars to make these choices.

As for current need, I think Liam still needs a RB a bit more than he needs a WR. However, I think he did need the WR too, so maybe he picks up a RB later in the draft.
I think Olave has great potential to be an impact fantasy WR and he was in strong consideration at #6.

##### The Grade: B+
----
#### 1.08 - James Cook (Bad News Beers)
##### Position: RB
##### Base Salary: $121
##### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $65

Cook, much like 1.02 pick Ken Walker, is being projected as part of a timeshare with a veteran back.
Similar to Walker, it would not surprise anyone if Cook ends up taking over lead back duties in Buffalo as soon as this year.
Devin Singletary is a solid back but has never been able to separate him from guys like Zack Moss.
Cook should be able to do everything Singletary already does.

I would not be surprised if Cook blows this projection out of the water.
The Beers already have a deep WR room, so I like adding Cook, especially as insurance for Cam Akers should he falter this season.

*(Ed)itor's Note: Josh Allen is actually the RB1 on this team.*

##### The Grade: A
----
#### 1.09 - Skyy Moore (Team Estelle)
##### Position: WR
##### Base Salary: $113
##### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $61

The 9th pick represents another drop-off in salary, going down $8 now instead of $5.
In his second selection of this 1st round, Tony goes with Skyy Moore to bolster his WR room.

The biggest thing for Tony is just plain-old talent acquisition, and I like this move more than taking, say, Kenny Pickett.
No one should expect Skyy Moore to replace Tyreek Hill, and the team did just sign JuJu Smith-Schuster.
However, everyone is working to get targets from their new QB Pat Mahomes, and there's no reason Moore can't carve out a role in his rookie year and beyond.

##### The Grade: A-
----
#### 1.10 - Kenny Pickett (Dayman & The Nightman)
##### Position: QB
##### Base Salary: $105
##### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: -$11

Finally, the first QB is off the board. Most expected Pickett to be the first QB taken, but there was a lot of uncertainty of when he might go.
Jake at #5 was rumored, as was Tony at #9. Ultimately, Dayman & The Nightman replace last year's consensus top QB, Trevor Lawrence, with this year's.

Personally, I don't love Pickett as a player. In historically weak QB classes, the top ones can get overhyped simply because some of them have to be good...right?
There were plenty of QBs who went in Free Agency for less than $105 who I'd rather have this year and next rather than Pickett.
However, if Pickett does become an NFL level starter as soon as next year, this could help Dayman & The Nightman expedite their rebuild.

##### The Grade: C+
----

### TRADE ALERT
The Tuna Fish have been interested in moving into the late first round all week, and it appears they have finally found a suitor.

#### Tuna Fish receives:
| Player | POS | Contract | Yrs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2022 1.11 | - | $97 | 3+1 |

#### The RatCats receive:
| Player | POS | Contract | Yrs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2022 2.09 | - | $45 | 3 |
| 2023 2nd | - | - | 3 |
| Nico Collins | WR | $6 | 2 |

Spoiler alert, but we know that the Tuna Fish will use this pick to select WR George Pickens, so we can evaluate the trade with him in mind.
Al and Chuck clearly like Pickens and have been targeting him in the late first round for a while.
He represents a slight upgrade this year from Collins in terms of projected dollars, but it comes with a steep pay raise.
Tuna Fish will be paying Pickens roughly $90 more this year than they would Collins. Trading up using their 2nd round pick helps free up some of that money, since they already had the $45 allocated.
It's another good, young WR added to an already young, up-and-coming WR group.

For Zach, I think it's pretty good value for a late 1st rounder, especially if you view Collins as a WR poised to take the Year 2 Leap.
For starters, he picks up some decent draft capital with the 2.09 this year and a 2nd rounder in next year's deep class.
Moving his 1.11 down to 2.09 also frees up $52 in allocated draft space, and he might be able to find a cheap contributor at the bottom of the 2nd round.
Collins is an ultra cheap addition to a WR group that is an interesting collection of talents.
Spearheaded by Tyreek Hill and Mike Williams's breakout campaign, there's a number of young receivers who have the potential to make a big leap this season, including Elijah Moore, Kadarius Toney, and now Collins.
Zach is sitting on just under $200 in cap space, so he has room to make another splash on the cap-casualty market later this fall.

#### Grade
**Al and Chuck: B**  
**Zach: A-** 

A good example of how different priorities can mean different things for different teams. I think it is a mutually beneficial trade.

For Tuna Fish, I think this is pretty much what you'll see as their opening roster.
The team has had a successful free agency and now rookie draft, so you hope the 2023 2nd isn't at the top of the round.
Still, it's a bet made on a player who has yet to play an NFL game.

The RatCats make a move to acquire a variety of assets, one of those assets being cap space.
This team probably isn't done adding yet, and it adds a reasonably valuable asset in the 2023 draft.
Obviously, the outcome of this trade depends on the development of Collins and Pickens, but Zach has that bet hedged better.

----
#### 1.11 - George Pickens (Tuna Fish)
##### Position: WR
##### Base Salary: $97
##### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $53

I already covered a lot of the rationale behind this pick above, but I will recap it.
Al and Chuck see Pickens as a solid final piece to this year's roster and beyond.
The team is built pretty well to compete this year, especially if one of these young receivers has a true breakout year.

Pickens is obviously an investment, as receivers take time to develop in the NFL.
There's the price of time, and there was the price to move up and take him, which in this case was Nico Collins and a future 2nd rounder.
I think the pick essentially reflects the grade of the trade.

##### The Grade: B
----
#### 1.12 - Christian Watson (Big Dirty Shit-Hawks)
##### Position: WR
##### Base Salary: $89
##### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $73

With the last pick in the first round, Kevin adds to an already strong WR room.
Kevin already was rostering DJ Moore, Justin Jefferson, Mike Evans, and Marquise Brown, and he was able to capitalize on Tyler Lockett's cap-casualty cut and pick him up for $46.
His RB room is also full enough that it didn't really matter which position he went with here.

Watson is 6'5 and runs a 4.36 40, so I don't understand the hate he's gotten.
Sure, he came from a small program, but Aaron Rodgers has made fantasy relevant WRs out of players with worse archetypes than Watson.
Also notable is Watson's $89 base salary, which is the lowest salary that comes with a 4th year option.

##### The Grade: B+

Thanks for reading and stay tuned for future draft and free agency coverage!
