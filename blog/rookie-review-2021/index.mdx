Our league had a unique feature in 2021. NFL Rookies were drafted as part of our initial auction, thus were not subject to typical rookie deals.
This is going to have lasting implications moving forward, as players who may have been a steal in the rookie draft are already making top dollar.
To be fair, there are also players making serious money whose owners are probably wishing they were on a 1.1 contract (looking at you, Trevor Lawrence).
On the other hand, players like Pat Freiermuth are on a minimum deal for 4 more seasons, which would not be possible through the rookie draft.

This got me wondering what our league might have looked like if we had a typical rookie draft. Trevor Lawrence was handed the top contract, but I don't think he would have been in consideration as the first overall pick in the rookie draft.
Since we can't go back in time to see what a rookie draft might have looked like, we'll turn to the internet.
I'll be basing this article off of this <Link to="https://fantasyfootballcalculator.com/adp/rookie/12-team/all/2021" target="_blank">2021 Dynasty League Rookie ADP</Link> article.
The one thing that isn't considered here is that the ADP is likely based off of non-Superflex leagues. With quarterbacks being slightly more valuable in our format, I reserve the right to move some QBs up in the list.
I will note where players were moved up, and try to provide some reasoning.
