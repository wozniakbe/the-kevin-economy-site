Our league had a unique feature in 2021. NFL Rookies were drafted as part of our initial auction, thus were not subject to typical rookie deals.
This is going to have lasting implications moving forward, as players who may have been a steal in the rookie draft are already making top dollar.
To be fair, there are also players making serious money whose owners are probably wishing they were on a 1.1 contract (looking at you, Trevor Lawrence).
On the other hand, players like Pat Freiermuth are on a minimum deal for 4 more seasons, which would not be possible through the rookie draft.

This got me wondering what our league might have looked like if we had a typical rookie draft. Trevor Lawrence was handed the top contract, but I don't think he would have been in consideration as the first overall pick in the rookie draft.
Since we can't go back in time to see what a rookie draft might have looked like, we'll turn to the internet.
I'll be basing this article off of this <a href="https://fantasyfootballcalculator.com/adp/rookie/12-team/all/2021" target="_blank">2021 Dynasty League Rookie ADP</a> article.
The one thing that isn't considered here is that the ADP is likely based off of non-Superflex leagues. With quarterbacks being slightly more valuable in our format, I reserve the right to move some QBs up in the list.
I will note where players were moved up, and try to provide some reasoning.

As always, dollar amounts referenced in this article can be found on the <Link to="/production">Production</Link> page.

Also, player tables are in the order that they are drafted. If you want to know why all of the tables in the articles are currently limited to 4 columns, do some research on why using global CSS is a bad idea.

### Round 1

| Player | Draft | Real | Return |
|---|---|---|---|
| Najee Harris | $150 | $300 | $59 |
| Kyle Pitts | $147 | $181 | -$72 |
| Javonte Williams | $144 | $97 | $103 |
| Ja'Marr Chase | $141 | $210 | $143 |
| Trevor Lawrence | $136 | $352 | -$316 |
| Justin Fields | $131 | $245 | -$258 |
| Trey Lance | $126 | $200 | -$236 |
| DeVonta Smith | $121 | $90 | $43 |
| Zach Wilson | $113 | $100 | -$97 |
| Trey Sermon | $105 | $45 | -$52 |
| Jaylen Waddle | $97 | $112 | $96 |
| Mac Jones | $89 | $40 | $45 |

I think Najee Harris is well deserving of the number one overall pick. Najee didn't go below the second overall pick in the mock data used, and for good reason.
He was the Steelers workhorse all year, finished as the RB4, and was well worth a $150. Najee produced $359 on the year, which would have looked a lot better if he was making $150 instead of $300.

The next 3 players taken could probably go in any order, but they represent the next 3 best skill players on the board. With Kyle Pitts, you know you're getting an investment.
Rookie tight ends don't typically produce, and even if Pitts was making the salary of the 9th pick in the first round, he would have still lost money.
Going into year two, this is make-or-break time for Pitts to show he's worth the investment.

My belief in Javonte Williams can be found in my <Link to="../best-assets-into-2022">2022 Best Trade Assets</Link> article, and the Broncos just traded for Russell Wilson. Not a bad situation to be in. Javonte is the only player to be making less money than his ADP would have given him in a normal draft until DeVonta Smith at number 8.
I won't repeat my points, but I think having Javonte Williams on this contract is great value, and would have never happened in a typical rookie draft.

Ja'Marr Chase somehow producing $143 on a $210 contract is an incredible fantasy season for any player. For a rookie wide receive, it's elite.
When Chase went for over $200 in our auction draft, I thought it was a mistake. Our rookie scale had not been determined at the time, but even without it, $210 is a large investment for a player without a single NFL snap.
Chase proved me wrong big time, finishing as the WR4 and returning the second most amount of dollars in this rookie mock draft.

The next group of players to go in our mock draft is the group of highly paid rookie QBs. I moved Justin Fields ahead of Trey Lance due to Chicago bias, and I think evidence of this is clear in Fields' salary.
Another thing this group of players has in common is the massive financial losses they all incurred on the year.
Trevor Lawrence leads with way with his $-316, which was the 2nd worst return in the entire league, behind Christian McCaffrey's -$426 return.
Fields and Lance didn't do much more to impress, both losing much more than $200.

It's not totally impossible for rookie QBs to make money, however, as Mac Jones made $45 this year on his measly $40 salary. In our mock draft, I actually moved Mac up 3 spots.
I just don't think that a potentially starting QB would make it out of the first round, and on his projected $89 salary, Mac actually lost $4.
The other QB taken in the first round was Zach Wilson, who I also moved up from his projected 2.01 selection. Zach Wilson actually was paid $13 less than he would have in our mock draft, but he still lost $97 on the year.
