Our league had a unique feature in 2021. NFL Rookies were drafted as part of our initial auction, thus were not subject to typical rookie deals.
This is going to have lasting implications moving forward, as players who may have been a steal in the rookie draft are already making top dollar.
To be fair, there are also players making serious money whose owners are probably wishing they were on a 1.1 contract (looking at you, Trevor Lawrence).
On the other hand, players like Pat Freiermuth are on a minimum deal for 4 more seasons, which would not be possible through the rookie draft.

This got me wondering what our league might have looked like if we had a typical rookie draft. Trevor Lawrence was handed the top contract, but I don't think he would have been in consideration as the first overall pick in the rookie draft.
Since we can't go back in time to see what a rookie draft might have looked like, we'll turn to the internet.
I'll be basing this article off of this <a href="https://fantasyfootballcalculator.com/adp/rookie/12-team/all/2021" target="_blank">2021 Dynasty League Rookie ADP</a> article.
The one thing that isn't considered here is that the ADP is likely based off of non-Superflex leagues. With quarterbacks being slightly more valuable in our format, I reserve the right to move some QBs up in the list.
I will note where players were moved up, and try to provide some reasoning.

As always, dollar amounts referenced in this article can be found on the <Link to="/production">Production</Link> page.

Also, player tables are in the order that they are drafted. If you want to know why all of the tables in the articles are currently limited to 4 columns, do some research on why using global CSS is a bad idea.

### Round 1

| Player | Draft | Real | Return |
|---|---|---|---|
| Najee Harris | $150 | $300 | $59 |
| Kyle Pitts | $147 | $181 | -$72 |
| Javonte Williams | $144 | $97 | $103 |
| Ja'Marr Chase | $141 | $210 | $143 |
| Trevor Lawrence | $136 | $352 | -$316 |
| Justin Fields | $131 | $245 | -$258 |
| Trey Lance | $126 | $200 | -$236 |
| DeVonta Smith | $121 | $90 | $43 |
| Zach Wilson | $113 | $100 | -$97 |
| Trey Sermon | $105 | $45 | -$52 |
| Jaylen Waddle | $97 | $112 | $96 |
| Mac Jones | $89 | $40 | $45 |

I think Najee Harris is well deserving of the number one overall pick. Najee didn't go below the second overall pick in the mock data used, and for good reason.
He was the Steelers workhorse all year, finished as the RB4, and was well worth a $150. Najee produced $359 on the year, which would have looked a lot better if he was making $150 instead of $300.

The next 3 players taken could probably go in any order, but they represent the next 3 best skill players on the board. With the #2 pick, Kyle Pitts, you know you're getting an investment.
Rookie tight ends don't typically produce, and even if Pitts was making the salary of the 9th pick in the first round, he would have still lost money.
Going into year two, this is make-or-break time for Pitts to show he's worth the investment.

My belief in #3 pick Javonte Williams can be found in my <Link to="../best-assets-into-2022">2022 Best Trade Assets</Link> article, and the Broncos just traded for Russell Wilson. Not a bad situation to be in. Javonte is the only player to be making less money than his ADP would have given him in a normal draft until DeVonta Smith at number 8.
I won't repeat my points, but I think having Javonte Williams on this contract is great value, and would have never happened in a typical rookie draft.

Ja'Marr Chase somehow producing $143 on a $210 contract is an incredible fantasy season for any player. For a rookie wide receiver, it's elite.
When Chase went for over $200 in our auction draft, I thought it was a mistake. Our rookie scale had not been determined at the time, but even without it, $210 is a large investment for a player without a single NFL snap.
Chase proved me wrong big time, finishing as the WR4 and returning the second most amount of dollars in this rookie mock draft.

The next group of players to go in our mock draft is the group of highly paid rookie QBs. I moved Justin Fields (#6) ahead of Trey Lance (#7) due to Chicago bias, and I think evidence of this is clear in Fields' salary.
Another thing this group of players has in common is the massive financial losses they all incurred on the year.
Our #5 pick, Trevor Lawrence, leads with way with his $-316, which was the 2nd worst return in the entire league, behind Christian McCaffrey's -$426 return.
Fields and Lance didn't do much more to impress, both losing far more than $200.

It's not totally impossible for rookie QBs to make money, however, as #12 pick Mac Jones made $45 this year on his measly $40 salary. In our mock draft, I actually moved Mac up 3 spots.
I just don't think that a potentially starting QB would make it out of the first round, and on his projected $89 salary, Mac actually lost $4.
The other QB taken in the first round was #9 pick Zach Wilson, who I also moved up from his projected 2.01 selection. Zach Wilson actually was paid $13 less than he would have in our mock draft, but he still lost $97 on the year.

All first round picks have at least 2 years remaining on their contracts, with the exceptions of Trevor Lawrence and Zach Wilson.

### Round 2

| Player | Draft | Real | Return |
|---|---|---|---|
| Michael Carter | $75 | $100 | $19 |
| Terrace Marshall | $72 | $22 | -$42 |
| Elijah Moore | $69 | $28 | $46 |
| Rondale Moore | $66 | $13 | $39 |
| Dyami Brown | $62 | $5 | -$27 |
| Amon-Ra St. Brown | $58 | $15 | $144 |
| Kadarius Toney | $54 | $5 | $12 |
| Kenneth Gainwell | $50 | $5 | $49 |
| Pat Freiermuth | $45 | $5 | $49 |
| Chuba Hubbard | $40 | $16 | $60 |
| Amari Rodgers | $35 | $15 | -$38 |
| Josh Palmer | $30 | $7 | $12 |

The only player in this round to make more money than his theoretical draft slot is Michael Carter. Carter still returned $19, and appeared to gain a stronger role in the Jets' offense as the season progressed.
He joins Kenneth Gainwell and Chuba Hubbard as the only three RBs taken in the round. Both Gainwell and Hubbard returned solid money, although Gainwell looks to be the one with a better future.
Gainwell is on a 5 year minimum deal, which could prove to be a steal. Hubbard could potentially benefit from Christian McCaffrey absences, but he's entering Free Agency with a lot less hype than he had last offseason.

The second pick in the round goes to WR Terrace Marshall, who I would love to see turn into Alshon Jeffery 2.0, but is nowhere near there right now.
Marshall was a non-factor all season, and was a negative asset even on his cheap deal. With 4 more seasons to figure it out, the contract could still turn out to be a strong value.
Joining in the "disappointing rookie WR" category is Dyami Brown. Brown is rocking a minimum 5 year deal, so he too could prove to be a bargain once his contract runs its course.
Last year, however, Brown was a net negative even on a minimum contract. Even when he was involved in the offense, Brown never got going, only hauling in 12 of his 25 targets with no touchdowns.

Remember earlier when I said that JaMarr Chase returned the *second-most* amount of dollars this season by a rookie? Meet the highest dollar return in the rookie class, WR Amon-Ra St. Brown!
Do I think St. Brown is a better player than JaMarr Chase? No. Is he a better investment? *Strong maybe*. His $15 contract is great value for where he would go in a theoretical rookie re-draft.

I do not look forward to the next 4 years where I have to remind Nick and Eddie how much I regret not bidding on Pat Freiermuth. On a minimum 5 year deal, Freiermuth is a super underrated asset, and a bargain at his draft slot.

### Round 3

| Player | Draft | Real | Return |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nico Collins | $20 | $6 | $8 |
| Javian Hawkins | $18 | $0 | $0 |
| Rhamondre Stevenson | $16 | $6 | $62 |
| D'Wayne Eskridge | $14 | $5 | -$26 |
| Seth Williams | $12 | $0 | $0 |
| Tutu Atwell | $10 | $5 | -$44 |
| Jaret Patterson | $8 | $5 | $8 |
| Hunter Long | $6 | $0 | $0 |
| Elijah Mitchell | $5 | $69 | $77 |
| Kyle Trask | $5 | $0 | $0 |
| Kellen Mond | $5 | $0 | $0 |
| Davis Mills | $5 | $5 | -$4 |

Round 3 is mostly boring outside of two players. Rhamondre Stevenson had some stellar fantasy weeks this season and has good potential to take the Patriots starting RB job from Damien Harris in the future.
He might not be a workhorse back, but he's making $6 for 3 more years.

The only "overpaid" player on this list is the highest producer, RB Elijah Mitchell.
Mitchell went undrafted in our initial auction, and after a huge Week 1, was added via waivers for $69 (nice). His salary being so high is a product of waivers, and he would have produced so much more on a rookie contract.

The rest of the round was mostly useless this season, as you'd expect out of a third round.
I will leave you with my favorite fact of our theoretical draft: Davis Mills outgained Trevor Lawrence by $312.

Thanks for reading.
