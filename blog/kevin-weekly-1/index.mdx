A lot has gone down since my last <Link to="../early-june-trade-analysis">trade review article</Link>.
RFA tags are coming in, Liam finally joined the Slack group, Tuna Fish has shaken up the draft yet again, and two top 4 running backs (and the #20) are on the move.
Rather than try to cover everything and ramble on as I love to do, I'll cover all these topics and more in a concise format.


Welcome to the first edition of the *Kevin Weekly*.

## Trade Grades
In the first of two blockbusters, two of the top 4 running backs in the league switched teams.

#### Big Dirty Shit-Hawks receive:
| Player | POS | Contract | Yrs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Austin Ekeler | RB | $299 | 2 |
| 2023 3rd | - | - | - |

#### Dayman & The Nightman receive:
| Player | POS | Contract | Yrs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Najee Harris | RB | $330 | 2 |
| Michael Gallup | WR | $37 | 2 |

This is a super interesting trade with the value of these running backs considered. Adding $30 above Ekeler's salary for Najee and another $37 for Michael Gallup hurts Nick and Eddie's free agency choices, but Gallup should be a decent surplus when he returns from injury.
I think for the present year, this is a bigger win for Kevin, as he gets the slightly better running back for slightly cheaper, and can afford to shed Gallup's $37 after acquiring both Mike Evans and Marquise Brown earlier in the offseason.
He's primed to make a big splash in Free Agency, having the most money available of all teams by far.

For Nick and Eddie, it's a slight play for the future without too much of a present day hit. My sources have confirmed with the team that Najee and Ekeler's contract lengths made this trade attractive for Nick and Eddie, with both contracts running out in 2 years.
Najee being the younger back is more likely to still be a valuable NFL running back at that point. The future pick they give up is pretty negligible in value for the ability to RFA Najee in two seasons.

### Grade 
**Kevin: A**  
**Nick/Eddie: B** 

I really love the upgrade at RB for Kevin while shedding salary, especially for a team that is clearly looking to win now.
That 2023 3rd has probably been shopped at least twice by now.

Nick and Eddie grade out fine here, just not in slam dunk territory. The move feels mostly lateral, although I can appreciate the future contract considerations.
I think their best path out of this trade doesn't even involve extending Najee, rather trading him for a good young player and 2023 draft considerations if he has another strong year.

In hopes of having my "coward" label removed, it's time to review the second trade involving 2022 first round picks for the Tuna Fish.

#### Team Estelle receives:
| Player | POS | Contract | Yrs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2022 1.09 | - | $113 | 3+1 |

#### Tuna Fish receive:
| Player | POS | Contract | Yrs |
|---|---|---|---|
| David Montgomery | RB | $192 | 2 |
| 2023 3rd | - | - | - |

On the surface, I thought this trade looked pretty good for both teams.
I have been waiting for Tony to make more aggressive rebuilding moves, and trading Montgomery with two years left on his contract was probably the best time to do so.
The Tuna Fish had been reluctant to part with their 9th overall pick, and for good reason. I think the $113 salary combined with the pool available at that point should provide a solid player.

For the Tuna Fish, it's a big bet on their ability to sign at least one star Free Agent, if not two.
Even if the team brings back Restricted Free Agent George Kittle, there are multiple spots in the starting lineup to fill.
With the team already paying Cole Kmet and Jonnu Smith over $80, a Kittle reunion seems unlikely without an absolute bargain.
I think this trade can work out, there is just a lot that needs to go right in Free Agency.
Montgomery can provide more production than the 9th overall pick this season, but I am skeptical that is going to make a difference.
This being said, I cannot wait to miss the playoffs again to this team.

### Grade 
**Tony: B+**  
**Al/Chuck: C+**

I appreciate Tony making moves for the future. David Montgomery figures to sit on the border of RB1 in our league, and solidly as an RB2.
A late-round 1st round pick might not be what you envision being the sole return for Monty, but it's really not bad.
Maybe my opinion will change after seeing a real rookie draft in our league, but I'm excited for the player Tony is lined up to get as his second 1st rounder.

As for Al and Chuck, I'm bringing some criticism to this one. My critical takes tend to come back to bite me.
I may or may not have given our eventual champion Nosmo King the lowest draft grade on draft night...

But if I always gave out A's and B's in trade grades, I may as well not even write the articles.
This trade just seems to have a whiff of impatience to me, and I don't think David Montgomery was the missing piece to the Tuna Fish roster.
Maybe I'm disrespecting  the reigning division champs, but I just don't see it, especially after a rebuilding move to send Mike Evans packing.

## 2021 Awards: All-Contract Teams
Each All-Contract Team features 1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 TE, 1 Superflex, and 2 Flexes.
I graded these pretty heavily based on dollars returned and ROI, but kept in consideration that the player had to be a strong contributor at his position.

*Positions omitted from the tables because I suck at formatting websites.*

### First Team
| Name | Salary | Return | ROI |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tom Brady | $205 | $159 | 77.85% |
| Leonard Fournette | $20 | $270 | 1352% |
| Cordarrelle Patterson | $5 | $257 | 5154% |
| Cooper Kupp | $112 | $407 | 364% |
| Deebo Samuel | $87 | $289 | 333% |
| Hunter Renfrow | $5 | $268 | 5375% |
| Mark Andrews | $120 | $173 | 144% |
| James Conner | $56 | $222 | 397% |
| Brandin Cooks | $25 | $178 | 712% |
| Darrel Williams | $10 | $173 | 1733% |

The first team was led by **MVP Cooper Kupp** and his top-of-the-league $407 return. His 364% ROI as the top WR wasn't bad, either.

**Cordarrelle Patterson** and **Hunter Renfrow** shared the "**Best Contract**" honors.
When you can return 5000% (not a typo) and be a top player at your position, it's pretty hard to choose between these guys.

### Second Team
| Name | Salary | Return | ROI |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kirk Cousins | $80 | $150 | 188% |
| Damien Harris | $52 | $165 | 318% |
| Melvin Gordon | $44 | $132 | 302% |
| Marquise Brown | $16 | $173 | 1083% |
| Mike Williams | $40 | $170 | 425% |
| Michael Pittman | $30 | $162 | 541% |
| Dalton Schultz | $7 | $128 | 1836% |
| Carson Wentz | $17 | $148 | 875% |
| Christian Kirk | $18 | $147 | 818% |
| Amon-Ra St. Brown | $15 | $144 | 961% |

There were some tough choices to leave off the list, but all of these players provided a large ROI while also producing a meaningful amount of money.

## RFA First Looks
RFA tags are due on July 1st, and a lot have already come in. All of the names are subject to change until the deadline, but the group is loaded.

| Name | POS | Old $ | Tag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ryan Tannehill | QB | $313 | $502 |
| Hunter Renfrow | WR | $5.50 | $386 |
| Juju Smith-Schuster | WR | $100 | $386 |
| Deebo Samuel | WR | $95 | $386 |
| Cordarrelle Patterson | RB | $5.50 | $439 |
| Derrick Henry | RB | $423 | $439 |
| Joe Mixon | RB | $324 | $439 |
| Saquon Barkley | RB | $434 | $439 |
| Ezekiel Elliott | RB | $363 | $439 |
| Myles Gaskin | RB | $214 | $439 |
| Travis Kelce | TE | $374 | $230 |
| George Kittle | TE | $330 | $230 |
| Dalton Schultz | TE | $7.70 | $230 |
| Cameron Brate | TE | $5.50 | $230 |

What's potentially bigger news than this list is who's currently missing from the list. Both Patrick Mahomes and Christian McCaffrey are set to be unrestricted free agents, with Kevin choosing to tag Ezekiel Elliott and Dalton Schultz.
This is still subject to change, but even if it does, that opens up another interesting name. Simply put, it's a good year to have some money to spend in free agency.

I fully expect Justin Jefferson, Aaron Jones, and James Connor to join this list.
It is looking likely that RFAs will not be force-nominated first, which means this free agency draft is set up to be very deep.
I think there might be some funny looking contracts in 2022 because we all simply ran out of money. Spend wisely, friends.

## Upcoming Dates
#### RFA Tag Deadline 
RFA tags are due on July 1st. Don't be that guy.

#### Free Agency Draft
