Back in September, I wrote an article about my <Link to="../top-five-trade-assets-pre-2021">Top 5 Trade Assets in The Kevin</Link>.
I wanted to capture value as a mix of current production, situation, and age. What I failed to realize was how much salary can shape a player's actual value.
Take the MVP of the 2021 Champion Nosmo Kings, RB Cordarrelle Patterson, for example. Patterson was no doubt one of the top fantasy players this season, the 24th overall scorer in The Kevin.
What made him so valuable, however, was his $5 salary. Having space to build a roster is so valuable, and sometimes hard to put a number on.
I'll go into the dollar values in a future article, but being able to define what a player's production is *actually worth* lets us put a more accurate value on each player.

With this in mind, let's take a look at how much value each of my 2021 Top 5 generated based on his contract.
#### 5. QB Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills
**2021 Salary:** $570  
**2021 Production:** $335  
**2021 ROI:** -27.87%
#### 4. RB Dalvin Cook, Minnesota Vikings
**2021 Salary:** $451  
**2021 Production:** $207  
**2021 ROI:** -54.01%  
#### 3. QB Kyler Murray, Arizona Cardinals
**2021 Salary:** $471  
**2021 Production:** $227  
**2021 ROI:** -51.82%  
#### 2. RB Christian McCaffrey, Carolina Panthers
**2021 Salary:** $500  
**2021 Production:** $74  
**2021 ROI:** -85.24%  
#### 1. QB Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs
**2021 Salary:** $580  
**2021 Production:** $335  
**2021 ROI:** -42.24%  


That is...not great. Add in the injuries sustained to Cook and McCaffrey, plus Kyler's uncertainty in Arizona, and this is looking like an unimpressive list of contracts.
I probably should have titled the 2021 article, "Ben Ranks the Consensus Top 5 QB/RBs in Dynasty and Doesn't Look at Financials", but that doesn't have a great ring to it.
When talking about trade values in a salary cap dynasty league, salaries are so important. And as it turns out, it is really difficult to live up to a big salary.

Now that I've shredded my previous article's credibility, let me tell you why this list is going to be different. Instead of writing down things I *think* will happen, I'm going to make conclusions based on things that *actually happened*.
Numbers! Dollars! Statistical analysis! A lot of fun words that sound smart. I still chose some arbitrary criteria to make this list, but it's better than nothing.
Unfortunately, I still don't have a great way to display full data tables on the site, but I will try to show as much as I can. Let's get started.

### Defining a Player Pool
First, I took all of the players this season who returned a profit. Any profit at all. The high man on the totem pole is Hunter Renfrow and his $269, 5375.31% ROI return, with Aaron Rodgers bringing up the bottom with his measly $3, 0.90% ROI.
Some other high scorers in the positive category included Tom Brady, Kirk Cousins, and Mark Andrews. Khalil Herbert makes an appearance on the list!
Overall, there are 145 players who returned a profit, basically 12 per team on average. Factor in adds/drops, and a bit under 50% of rostered players are making money.

Since this resulted in a pretty large pool, I increased the bar to be players who returned at least $100 of production. When I say returning money, I mean the player's value produced minus his salary.

I chose $100 because it's a nice number. That's it. It's about 4.5% of our cap, so maybe think about it as a 5% return on the cap. Whatever floats your boat.
When we're talking about the best trade assets in the league, absolute production is important to consider. A 300% ROI is nice, but Khalil Herbert producing $31 on his $5 contract probably isn't the centerpiece in a deal (sorry Al).
There were 32 players who returned over $100, led by names such as Cooper Kupp, Hunter Renfrow, Cordarrelle Patterson, Deebo Samuel, and Leonard Fournette.

Finally, I filtered out all players who were on 1 year contracts. These players are due for a raise, and as pending FAs, there isn't much trade value. I also filtered out one Mr. Tom Brady, who ended his career producing $365 last season.
Players with only 1 year remaining are at a disadvantage compared to players on longer deals, but should still hold a reasonably high level of trade value in their last year under contract.
Here is the final list.

| Player | Pos | Salary | Return |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cooper Kupp | WR | $112 | $408 |
| Brandin Cooks | WR | $25 | $178 |
| Mark Andrews | TE | $120 | $174 |
| Marquise Brown | WR | $16 | $173 |
| Mike Williams | WR | $40 | $170 |
| Damien Harris | RB | $52 | $166 |
| Michael Pittman | WR | $30 | $162 |
| Kirk Cousins | QB | $80 | $151 |
| Carson Wentz | QB | $17 | $149 |
| Christian Kirk | WR | $18 | $147 |
| Amon-Ra St. Brown | WR | $15 | $144 |
| Ja'Marr Chase | WR | $210 | $143 |
| Jalen Hurts | QB | $155 | $142 |
| Austin Ekeler | RB | $272 | $132 |
| Tony Pollard | RB | $12 | $126 |
| Tee Higgins | WR | $85 | $115 |
| Van Jefferson | WR | $6 | $112 |
| AJ Dillon | RB | $60 | $112 |
| Jakobi Meyers | WR | $5 | $112 |
| Devin Singletary | RB | $50 | $109 |
| Javonte Williams | RB | $97 | $103 |
| Tyler Boyd | WR | $37 | $103 |

Now that we have a list, it could theoretically be as easy as sorting by most dollars returned, maybe by largest ROI, or maybe by factoring in contract years.
You're free to make your own conclusions from the table above, or from the entire player pool located on the <Link to="/production">Production</Link> page (which includes sorting, unlike this article).
Instead of taking the easy route, I'll insert just a bit of my own bias and attempt to filter the table down to my **Top 5 Trade Assets Entering the 2022 Offseasonâ„¢**.


(maybe 4) Jakobi Meyers - making the minimum $5 for 4 years, produced $117. Mac Jones possession QB, Jakobi 118 targets (T-18th with DK Metcalf and CeeDee Lamb)
Top ROI on the list with 2235.95% !!!
Only 2 TD - bound for regression

(1) Cooper Kupp - best overall investment in fantasy this year, into the prime of his career, prime is through 31. 184 targets is insane, OBJ out and Woods uncertain
Stafford connection is real. 

(probably 5) Javonte Williams - RB17 while Melvin Gordon was RB21, caught over 40 balls. Broncos have to do something at QB right?
$97 at 5 years is a late 1st round pick with an extra year on the deal. Looks to be a really good RB who produced in a timeshare and should keep getting more.

(3) Brandin Cooks - 129 targets and WR17 on the Texans. Potential to be traded to a better team, but Davis Mills improved under Pep Hamilton and could continue.
There's not a ton there to take targets away and with the team playing behind, the volume will be there. Making $25 for 4 more years years is 3rd round rookie money.

(2) Mark Andrews - 138 targets, tops amongst TEs. Led in points. 9 TD is big but as the 6th highest paid TE making almost 1/3 Kelce money, he's a steal at a tough position.
Tight Ends peak from 25 to 30, possibly into their mid 30s. Andrews is just starting to bloom as the best at the position at only 25 years old.
