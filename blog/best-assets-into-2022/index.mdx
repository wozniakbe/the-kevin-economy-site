Back in September, I wrote an article about my <Link to="../top-five-trade-assets-pre-2021">Top 5 Trade Assets in The Kevin</Link>.
I wanted to capture value as a mix of current production, situation, and age. What I failed to realize was how much salary can shape a player's actual value.
Take the MVP of the 2021 Champion Nosmo Kings, RB Cordarrelle Patterson, for example. Patterson was no doubt one of the top fantasy players this season, the 24th overall scorer in The Kevin.
What made him so valuable, however, was his $5 salary. Having space to build a roster is so valuable, and sometimes hard to put a number on.
I'll go into the dollar values in a future article, but being able to define what a player's production is *actually worth* lets us put a more accurate value on each player.

With this in mind, let's take a look at how much value each of my 2021 Top 5 generated based on his contract.
#### 5. QB Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills/The RatCats
**2021 Salary:** $570  
**2021 Production:** $335  
**2021 ROI:** -27.87%
#### 4. RB Dalvin Cook, Minnesota Vikings/Bangin' Dirty Coors
**2021 Salary:** $451  
**2021 Production:** $207  
**2021 ROI:** -54.01%  
#### 3. QB Kyler Murray, Arizona Cardinals/Nosmo King
**2021 Salary:** $471  
**2021 Production:** $227  
**2021 ROI:** -51.82%  
#### 2. RB Christian McCaffrey, Carolina Panthers/Big Dirty Shit-Hawks
**2021 Salary:** $500  
**2021 Production:** $74  
**2021 ROI:** -85.24%  
#### 1. QB Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs/Big Dirty Shit-Hawks
**2021 Salary:** $580  
**2021 Production:** $335  
**2021 ROI:** -42.24%  


That is...not great. Add in the injuries sustained to Cook and McCaffrey, plus Kyler's uncertainty in Arizona, and this is looking like an unimpressive list of contracts.
I probably should have titled the 2021 article, "Ben Ranks the Consensus Top 5 QB/RBs in Dynasty and Doesn't Look at Financials", but that doesn't have a great ring to it.
When talking about trade values in a salary cap dynasty league, salaries are so important. And as it turns out, it is really difficult to live up to a big salary.

Now that I've shredded my previous article's credibility, let me tell you why this list is going to be different. Instead of writing down things I *think* will happen, I'm going to make conclusions based on things that *actually happened*.
Numbers! Dollars! Statistical analysis! A lot of fun words that sound smart. I still chose some arbitrary criteria to make this list, but it's better than nothing.
Unfortunately, I still don't have a great way to display full data tables on the site, but I will try to show as much as I can. Let's get started.

### Defining a Player Pool
First, I took all of the players this season who returned a profit. Any profit at all. The high man on the totem pole is Hunter Renfrow and his $269, 5375.31% ROI return, with Aaron Rodgers bringing up the bottom with his measly $3, 0.90% ROI.
Some other high scorers in the positive category included Tom Brady, Kirk Cousins, and Mark Andrews. Khalil Herbert makes an appearance on the list!
Overall, there are 145 players who returned a profit, basically 12 per team on average. Factor in adds/drops, and a bit under 50% of rostered players are making money.

Since this resulted in a pretty large pool, I increased the bar to be players who returned at least $100 of production. When I say returning money, I mean the player's value produced minus his salary.

I chose $100 because it's a nice number. That's it. It's about 4.5% of our cap, so maybe think about it as a 5% return on the cap. Whatever floats your boat.
When we're talking about the best trade assets in the league, absolute production is important to consider. A 300% ROI is nice, but Khalil Herbert producing $31 on his $5 contract probably isn't the centerpiece in a deal (sorry Al).
There were 32 players who returned over $100, led by names such as Cooper Kupp, Hunter Renfrow, Cordarrelle Patterson, Deebo Samuel, and Leonard Fournette.

Finally, I filtered out all players who were on 1 year contracts. These players are due for a raise, and as pending FAs, there isn't much trade value. I also filtered out one Mr. Tom Brady, who ended his career producing $365 last season.
Players with only 1 year remaining are at a disadvantage compared to players on longer deals, but should still hold a reasonably high level of trade value in their last year under contract.
Here is the final list.

| Player | Pos | Salary | Return |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cooper Kupp | WR | $112 | $408 |
| Brandin Cooks | WR | $25 | $178 |
| Mark Andrews | TE | $120 | $174 |
| Marquise Brown | WR | $16 | $173 |
| Mike Williams | WR | $40 | $170 |
| Damien Harris | RB | $52 | $166 |
| Michael Pittman | WR | $30 | $162 |
| Kirk Cousins | QB | $80 | $151 |
| Carson Wentz | QB | $17 | $149 |
| Christian Kirk | WR | $18 | $147 |
| Amon-Ra St. Brown | WR | $15 | $144 |
| Ja'Marr Chase | WR | $210 | $143 |
| Jalen Hurts | QB | $155 | $142 |
| Austin Ekeler | RB | $272 | $132 |
| Tony Pollard | RB | $12 | $126 |
| Tee Higgins | WR | $85 | $115 |
| Van Jefferson | WR | $6 | $112 |
| AJ Dillon | RB | $60 | $112 |
| Jakobi Meyers | WR | $5 | $112 |
| Devin Singletary | RB | $50 | $109 |
| Javonte Williams | RB | $97 | $103 |
| Tyler Boyd | WR | $37 | $103 |

Now that we have a list, it could theoretically be as easy as sorting by most dollars returned, maybe by largest ROI, or maybe by factoring in contract years.
You're free to make your own conclusions from the table above, or from the entire player pool located on the <Link to="/production">Production</Link> page (which includes sorting, unlike this article).
Instead of taking the easy route, I'll insert just a bit of my own bias and attempt to filter the table down to my **Top 5 Trade Assets Entering the 2022 Offseasonâ„¢**.

### 5. RB Javonte Williams
#### Denver Broncos/The RatCats
**2021 Salary:** $97  
**Years Remaining:** 4  
**2021 Return:** $103

---
Javonte Williams is probably my biggest stretch on the list, and maybe the most subjective.
After all, he returned $103 last year, tied for the lowest on our final qualifying list.
The thing is, Williams returned this much money and finished as the RB17 despite sharing a backfield with Melvin Gordon.
Gordon received enough work to finish as the RB21, and he's an unrestricted free agent entering 2022.

This display of talent, with room left to grow, earns Williams the number 5 spot on this list.
Javonte already owns the pass-catching game out of the backfield, hauling in over 40 receptions in 2021.
Expect Williams to get the bulk of this work over the next few years, the Broncos to upgrade at QB, and he will be a top 5 RB on a late first round rookie contract.

### 4. WR Jakobi Meyers
#### New England Patroits/Drive-Thru Open Late
**2021 Salary:** $5  
**Years Remaining:** 3  
**2021 Return:** $112

---
Yea, I put one of my own players on the list.
From a pure production standpoint, Jakobi Meyers might not be what you'd consider a top asset in fantasy football.
What Jakobi has working for him is his $5 contract over the next 3 years, playing on a team that has no one else to throw the ball to.
His ROI of 2235.95% is the highest on this list, a pretty incredible number.

Jakobi received 126 targets over the 17 game season, with the next highest Patriot at 75. His 118 targets in weeks 1-17 were tied for 18th in the league, with DK Metcalf and CeeDee Lamb!
On top of that, he only hauled in 2 touchdowns on the year, and one has to hope for some positive regression in that category.
With Mac Jones at the helm for the foreseeable future, Jakobi is looking to get serious target volume. At $5 per season, that is great value.

### 3. WR Brandin Cooks
#### Houston Texans/Englewood Misunderstood Victims
**2021 Salary:** $25  
**Years Remaining:** 4  
**2021 Return:** $178

---
I feel like I barely heard Brandin Cooks' name all season long, yet he finished as the WR17 and hauled in 129 targets, all while playing for the Houston Texans.
Cooks has proven he can thrive even in bad situations, and there is always the potential he gets traded away to a better team as the Texans continue to rebuild.
If he stays in Houston, I still think there are reasons to be optimistic. Davis Mills looked respectable last season and improved as the year went along.

Regardless of where he is, Cooks has gotten 114 or more targets in 6 of the last 7 seasons. The volume and the talent are there, and perhaps most importantly, the money is not.
Cooks is on a $25 contract with 4 years remaining. For perspective, the first pick in our 3rd round makes $20.
His 2021 return of $178 ranks second on this list, and teams should be able to build a solid lineup around him and his small contract.

### 2. TE Mark Andrews
#### Baltimore Ravens/Bad News Beers
**2021 Salary:** $120  
**Years Remaining:** 2  
**2021 Return:** $174

---
Coming in at number 2 is Mark Andrews, who actually earns the most expensive salary on this list. Despite this, he returned the third largest amount of money in 2021, only behind Cooks and Cooper Kupp.
What makes Mark Andrews special is the position he plays. His 138 targets last season were the most at the position group, and he was the top scoring Tight End overall.
With other top TEs like Travis Kelce and George Kittle making $340 and $300 respectively, Andrews boasts great value making almost one-third of that money as the 6th highest paid TE.
Andrews did catch 9 touchdowns last season, a number that is probably due for some regression. The volume, however, should remain.

The peak for fantasy Tight Ends is typically from 25 to 30, with some of the game's best playing well into their mid-30's.
Going into his age 26 season, Andrews is primed to be a top player at the position for years to come. He does only have 2 years remaining on his contract, but even a franchise tag salary might be worth it once that is up.
With his skillset in its prime and his contract far below his production value, Andrews is one of the best assets in the league today.

### 1. WR Cooper Kupp
#### Los Angeles Rams/Englewood Misunderstood Victims
**2021 Salary:** $112  
**Years Remaining:** 4  
**2021 Return:** $408

---
The best overall production and return in fantasy this year. Entering the prime of his career. 184 targets.

It's no hot take to say that Cooper Kupp had one of the best fantasy seasons ever for a Wide Receiver, and he did it on the 26th most expensive contract at the position.
With 4 years remaining on his deal, Kupp should be a positive asset for the life of the contract. His connection with Matt Stafford is real. If you need proof, go watch the final drive of the Super Bowl.
The Rams have shown that they are committed to getting Kupp the ball, and volume equals production in a big way for Kupp.

The situation with the Rams receiver group is an interesting one. With OBJ possibly out the entire season with an ACL tear, he's no guarantee to return to the team.
Robert Woods is coming off a major injury of his own. Van Jefferson showed promise last year, making our final list ($6 contract, $112 returned) and finishing as the WR33.
Ultimately, Jefferson was left off the list due to his lower target share, and his role is not as defined with Robert Woods coming back.

What I think makes Kupp worthy of this #1 spot is that he's producing as the top WR in the game on what is essentially a mid-first round rookie contract.
His pure production was far beyond what anyone else produced this season, and even if he regresses to being a bottom-end WR1, the price is right.
You can build around Cooper Kupp, locking in your top WR, and still have money left over to invest at other positions.

### Closing
Don't get me wrong, big name players hold value even if they're making hundreds of dollars. However, being able to build a team around them is important.
Paying Cordarrelle Patterson only $5 makes it easier to hand out four contracts over $336.

Going into our first year of free agency, it will be interesting to see what players get paid compared to the initial auction.
You need star players to win, you need depth, and you need 10 respectable starters. Good luck spending your money!
