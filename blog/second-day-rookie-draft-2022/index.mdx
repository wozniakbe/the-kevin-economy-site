The draft flew by too quick for me to do a Rapid Reaction for Rounds 2 or 3, so I'm going to summarize each team's draft haul with their "Day Two" picks.
Check out the <Link to="../first-round-rookie-draft-2022">First Round Rapid Reaction</Link> article for those grades, as well as an explainer on the draft grading criteria.
The second round got a lost more interesting, with less consensus and less talent on the board.
The salary drops fast, also playing a big factor in evaluating the players taken at each respective slot.

The third round is even more of a crapshoot, and it's really hard to grade a lot of the selections.
I'm not an NFL GM or scout and I won't pretend to be! Most third rounders have to be evaluated with an open mind.
I'll be providing commentary on all of the picks but will not be assigning grades.

Teams will be listed in the order that they picked.

## The Roundup
#### Team Estelle
##### 2.01: WR Jahan Dotson $75
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $61
##### 3.01: WR Wan'Dale Robinson $20
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $13

Dotson was likely in play for the entire second half of the first round, but saw other receivers like Skyy Moore, George Pickens, and Christian Watson go ahead of him.
One of those guys was likely to drop, and Dotson happened to be that guy. Even the first pick in the 2nd round starts with a sharp decline in salary, as Dotson will make $14 less than Watson who went one pick prior.

Even though he doesn't get the fourth-year option, this is another talented player who has fallen into Tony's lap.
Adding Breece Hall, Skyy Moore, and Jahan Dotson with his first three picks is a solid success for this rebuilding team.

It's a similar story with Wan'Dale Robinson, someone who could have easily gone in the middle of the 2nd round. Tony picks up another talented young receiver, this time with an even sharper salary decrease, coming in at $20.
If Kadarius Toney ends up on the trade block, that could open up some targets for Robinson in his rookie year.
Either way, Robinson is a solid WR prospect, and Tony added a lot of young talent in this draft.

#### The RatCats
##### 2.02: RB Rachaad White $72
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $32
##### 2.09: WR Jalen Tolbert $45
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $56
##### 2.11: QB Malik Willis $35
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: -$86
##### 3.11: WR Danny Gray $5
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: -$25

Zach traded back from his first round selection and was able to turn that into Nico Collins and two solid 2nd round selections.
At the time I gave Zach an A- for the trade without seeing his selections, but seeing how he navigated the 2nd round, it locks in my grade.
Zach already had the 2.02, and was able to pick up Rachaad White at a $72 salary. White has a real chance to get carries and targets in this Tampa Bay offense.
Jalen Tolbert is another high upside WR who looks like a nice selection with his measly $45 salary. Tolbert comes in to the NFL with some injury concerns, and this is a Dallas offense with a lot of mouths to feed.
However, Dak historically spreads the ball around to 5-6 receivers consistently, so Tolbert has a chance to make an impact his rookie year.

Picking up Malik Willis at the end of the 2nd was another smart move. If Willis becomes a starting QB in any capacity over the next 3 years, his $35 salary will pale in comparison to his output, even if below average.
Danny Gray comes to the 49ers with some decent draft capital invested in him, being a 3rd round NFL pick. A $5 flyer here is another savvy pick.

#### Monks of Vegas
##### 2.03: RB Dameon Pierce $69
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $80
##### 3.02: WR Romeo Doubs $18
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: -$10
##### 3.05: RB Brian Robinson $12
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $17

Jake picked up one of my favorite prospects in the draft, Dameon Pierce, with the third pick in the second round.
Pierce has the inside track to the Texans starting role and is already projected to turn a profit in his rookie season.
Add in two more years of above average RB play and Pierce could end up as one of the most profitable players in this draft over the first 3 years.
Brian Robinson is another solid back that Jake added on a cheap contract. Robinson is a physical runner and has drawn A.J. Dillon comps for his style, and less fortunately, for his spot on the depth chart.
While Dillon has been getting more involved in the Green Bay offense over the years, Robinson will have to climb a crowded Washington depth chart.

Jake showed his determination to add pieces to his WR room during this draft, trading the 3.09 to Drive-Thru Open Late, along with two future third rounders, for WR Jakobi Myers.
My stance on Jakobi Myers has obviously dropped a bit, but I did name him the #4 most valuable asset in The Kevin back in my <Link to="../best-assets-into-2022">Best Assets Into 2022</Link> article.
So, one would have to say that getting Jakobi for a trio of late picks is a great get.

Jake continued getting guys he sees contributing to his team, trading a 2023 2nd round pick for Romeo Doubs.
This feels a bit aggressive, as the 2023 draft class is expected to be full of talent. Doubs has yet to take an NFL snap, and is a classic Camp Hypeâ„¢ scenario.
Doubs could end up being a great receiver, and I hope he does. This one just felt a bit over the top.

#### Poopy Ass Dolla
##### 2.04: RB Isaiah Spiller $66
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $60
##### 3.04: WR Tyquan Thornton $14
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: -$14

In the second round, Danny picked up Isaiah Spiller, who looks like a likely option to back up Austin Ekeler.
Spiller was higher on a lot of dynasty boards coming into the draft, but he fell to the Chargers in the 4th round, causing a bit of a slide in dynasty as well.
As you can tell, the league went on a bit of a RB run in the early 2nd round, and Spiller ended up right in the middle of the mix.
I think it's a good pick, as Spiller is a great candidate to get change of pace duties and fill in if Ekeler were to ever go down with an injury.
He's already projected to essentially break even in his rookie campaign.

Tyquan Thornton generated a lot of buzz in Patriots camp, but unfortunately went down with a collarbone injury in the team's second preseason contest.
He's expected to miss at least 8 weeks, but I don't think it matters too much for his fantasy outlook. Any production out of Thornton this year would be a bonus, but he has good value in years 2 and 3 of his contract.

#### Big Dirty Shit-Hawks
##### 2.05: RB Zamir White $62
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $4
##### 3.03: QB Desmond Ridder $16
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: -$45

Kevin picked up Zamir White in the Great Running Back Run of 2022, but White has one of the tougher paths to playing time.
Josh Jacobs is set for early down duty in Oakland, and the team already rosters Kenyan Drake and Brandon Bolden.
It's always possible White eventually cuts into some of Jacobs' carries, but it looks more like a wait and see type of investment.

Desmond Ridder at 3.03 is one of my favorite picks in the draft. Marcus Mariota is not a real hurdle for any legit NFL prospect, and if Ridder is even close to having average potential, he's likely to get on the field this season.
There's always the chance the Falcons bomb yet again and draft an early QB in next year's loaded draft.
But for $16, I think the dart throw on Ridder is 100% worth it. I like Ridder better than Pickett and Malik Willis, and he ended up the cheapest out of the bunch.

#### Drive-Thru Open Late
##### 2.06: RB Tyler Allgeier $58
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $67
##### 3.09: TE Jelani Woods $5
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: -$40

Hey, it's me, Drive-Thru Open Late. I might as well just explain why I like my own picks instead of trying to act like some neutral third-party.

For Allgeier, the potential for immediate playing time was too good to pass up at the RB position. Cordarrelle Patterson is already more of a receiving back than a runner, and he isn't getting any younger.
Allgeier is a powerful runner who has a good shot at taking over short yardage duties right away, and ideally, a good share of overall carries.

I traded my beloved Jakobi Myers for the 3.09, and two future third round picks. This admittedly is a bit of a low sell on Jakobi, but I haven't gotten substantial interest in him even going back to last season.
Jelani Woods is an absolutely perfect athlete at the TE position, and a lot of the Jakobi value came from getting someone who I believe can be a difference maker at the TE position, which is rare.
Time will tell what the other third round picks turn into, but my current depth at WR allowed me to trade for some extra dart throws.

#### Bangin' Dirty Coors
##### 2.07: WR David Bell $54
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $21
##### 3.06: WR Khalil Shakir
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: -$37
##### 3.07: RB Hassan Haskins $8
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $0

Liam continued to fortify his WR room in this draft, picking up David Bell and Khalil Shakir after adding Chris Olave in the first round.
Bell is the more immediate fantasy impact, as he should at least provide value as a low-end WR who can fill in for injuries or byes.
He's a posession receiver and a willing blocker, which should fit in perfectly in Cleveland's run-heavy offense.
As for Shakir, the Bills already signed Jameson Crowder to a WR room that already has Stefon Diggs and Gabriel Davis.
Shakir is buried on the Bills' depth chart, so he shouldn't see much playing time this year barring a lot of injuries.

Hassan Haskins is a PFF darling who had college rushing grades that pushed Breece Hall territory.
Derrick Henry is very much still a thing, but he missed a lot of time last season, and his backups didn't inspire a ton of fantasy hope.
Haskins has a chance to be the clear Derrick Henry backup, and should Henry miss any time, Haskins is a great value at $8.

#### Bad News Beers
##### 2.08: WR Alec Pierce $50
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $21
##### 3.08: QB Matt Corral $6
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: $0

Alec Pierce came off the board pretty late compared to some other risky receivers, but he already sits as the starting receiver for the Colts across from Michael Pittman.
A receiver with great size, the biggest knock you can make on Pierce at this point is that he's in an offense that revolves around Jonathan Taylor.
Parris Campbell is supposedly going to breakout one of these years, but it hasnt' happened yet.
I think Pierce has a great chance at beating his $21 projection that is quite honestly just outdated at this point.
He's one of my favorite day two picks and probably the best WR selection in the second round based on value alone.

Matt Corral comes off the board with the eighth pick in round three, and I think it's a good dart throw.
$6 is nothing, and Corral is set to sit on Will's practice squad unless he ends up with the starting job.
With Baker Mayfield and Sam Darnold seemingly the two participants in Carolina's QB competition this season, Corral may not provide an immediate return on investment.
However, he has a great shot at sitting out this season and getting a chance to be a starting quarterback as soon as 2023.

EDIT: While completing this article, Matt Corral suffered a likely season-ending foot injury.
In my opinion, it doesn't change his fantasy outlook much. There's no opportunity for playing time until 2023 anyway, and while the missed reps will hurt, he still has a chance to bounce back.

#### Englewood Misunderstood Victims
##### 2.10: RB Tyrion Davis-Price $40
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: -$12
##### 3.10: RB Pierre Strong Jr. $5
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: -$14

AJ went with more of an investment approach to his draft. Without a first round pick, AJ went with a couple of "prospect-y" prospects, with RBs Tyrion Davis-Price and Pierre Strong Jr.
His second round pick, Davis-Price, was critically received during the actual NFL draft. The 49ers spent a 3rd round pick on Trey Sermon last year, and already seem to have a solid starter in place with Elijah Mitchell.
However, if there's one thing we know about 49ers running backs, it's that we actually don't know anything.
Kyle Shanahan is not afraid of riding the hot hand, changing up touches based on matchups, and seemingly doing anything he can to mess with fantasy owners.
The team clearly likes this back if they invested yet another 3rd round pick on a RB, so look for Davis-Price to shatter this nothing-burger projection.
It's a risky pick but I think AJ will be able to stash him on his practice squad until he's a viable fantasy option.

Pierre Strong Jr. is another investment pick in a crowded New England backfield, which seemingly could have a different lead back each week. Sound familiar?
Strong is not regarded as a particularly impressive receiver or blocker, so he will have to improve in those areas to get on the field in a fundamentals-driven New England organization.
Time will tell if Strong can ever contribute as a fantasy running back.

#### Nosmo King
##### 2.12: TE Trey McBride $30
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: -$33
##### 3.12: RB Isiah Pacheco $5
###### ESPN/Yahoo Projection: -$8

Danny, much like the elder Basile, lacked a first round pick and went with more of an investment approach to his draft picks.
Danny held the 12th selection in both rounds, giving him the cheapest total salary possible for a 2nd and 3rd round pick.
Calling Trey McBride an investment might be a stretch, as we actually saw some Mock Drafts with McBride going in the first round.
Now, I think that would have been a major stretch, but I still expected McBride to end up going in the early 2nd round.
He might not have an immediate role in a crowded Arizona offense that sees McBride behind Zach Ertz at the TE position.
However, at $30 for the next three seasons, McBride has a good chance to be in the top 10 for most profitable TEs if he can earn the starting role by next season.

Isiah Pacheco is the preseason dynasty RB darling, with two positive showings already where he has pretty much done everything.
Solid running and pass catching along with kick return duties has gotten Pacheco on a lot of people's radars.
Unfortunately for this league, we only reward punt return yards, and Pacheco seems to be confined to kickoff duties.
Still, he inspires more promise than guys like Jerrick McKinnon and Ronald Jones, the other candidates to backup Clyde Edwards-Helaire.
CEH also was a bit disappointing last season, so there's even more helium that gives Pacheco a path to playing time.
He should blow his -$8 projection out of the water, which is pretty outdated.

As I've mentioned a lot, time will tell with a lot of these picks. The best we can do is analyze draftees' potential (talent and playing time) and their opportunity cost (salary and draft capital).
I look forward to revisiting some of this analysis a few years down the road to see what we've learned, and see how much drafting changes in our league.
Best of luck to everyone and their new rookies!
