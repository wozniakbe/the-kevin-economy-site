Let's get this offseason started! After a big shakeup atop the draft order, we have more player movement.
I'll be giving some rapid thoughts on both of the deals made yesterday, what I think they mean for both teams, and of course, the grades.

Now that we have a season under our belts, we know a lot more about the league. We can draw more conclusions on team directions, player worth, and future cap space.
All of these things differ from team to team, and therefore, no two teams are really looking at certain players and contracts the same ways.
This is probably obvious, but it is just a little primer into how I think the trades can be evaluated, as there is no guarantee of a zero-sum transaction.
Enough rambling on. Let's get into the trades.

#### Big Dirty Shit-Hawks receive:
| Player | POS | Contract | Yrs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zack Moss | RB | $28.60 | 2 |
| Devin Singletary | RB | $55 | 1 |
| James Robinson | RB | $90.20 | 2 |
| Marquise Brown | WR | $17.60 | 3 |

#### Monks of Vegas receive:
| Player | POS | Contract | Yrs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2022 3.09 | - | $5 | 3 |
| 2024 2nd | - | - | - |

Kevin is taking back a lot of salary here, which is definitely a big factor in the trade. Zack Moss is a cut candidate and could represent a modest $17 cap hit this season, or $8.50 if spread across two seasons.
That's pretty cheap as far as cap casualties go. James Robinson could be considered as a salary dump here as well, but his value is far above zero, and he could definitely break even on his $90 deal this year.

The productive pieces of the deal, Devin Singletary and Marquise Brown, are steals here. I acknowledge that a lot can happen between now and Week 1, but Devin Singletary is currently the Bills' RB1.
A starting RB on a $55 contract could easily provide a $100 surplus, which far outweighs the negatives of taking on Moss and Robinson. Add in Marquise Brown on a measly $17.60 contract, and we have another potential $100 of surplus value.
That's two huge pieces to plug into a starting lineup immediately for under $75.

As for the return for Jake here, I guess I get it. The Monks of Vegas were tight on cap space, and this opens up almost $200 of it. However, it also opens up 4 roster spots, including at least two in the starting lineup.
The 2024 could be good. Maybe. If the goal is to stock up on picks, I think moving some of the players separately would have netted more overall draft capital. The four players being packaged together tells me it's more about salary, though.

### Grade 
**Kevin: A**  
**Jake: C**  


Kevin still has plenty of money to spend in Free Agency, and just picked up two starters in the process. Jake is still pretty poor with a lot of roster holes to fill.

In a bit of a simpler trade, Tony sent a couple of Rams WRs over to Danny B for one of the Jets 15 WRs.

#### Team Estelle receives:
| Player | POS | Contract | Yrs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Corey Davis | WR | $20.90 | 3 |

#### Nosmo King receives:
| Player | POS | Contract | Yrs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tutu Atwell | WR | $5.50 | 4 |
| Allen Robinson | WR | $258 | 3 |

The prize of the trade is Allen Robinson, and perhaps for both teams. Danny picks up a receiver he clearly likes enough to spend over $250, and Tony gets the privilege of not paying him said money.
The defending champs are certainly still in win-now mode, and there's nothing wrong with paying a player big money to field the best team possible.
It's hard to hate on Danny for making the trade in theory, but I'm going to do it anyway. This team has multiple holes to fill with far less cap space to make that happen.
Free Agency is new to our league, so there's no telling what top players are going to go for on the free market in year 2. I feel that Danny probably could get more value out of A Rob's salary on the market.
As for Tutu Atwell, I'm writing him off as a flyer. A former 2nd round pick, he certainly has potential in this high-powered Rams offense. Right now, however, he doesn't figure to play a prominent role behind Robinson, Kupp, and Jefferson.

Tony dumps about $800 in future salary obligations, and also picks up a nice cheap player in return. Davis might not have a huge role in the Jets' offense this year after the team revamped their skill positions through the draft and free agency.
However, at $20.90, the bar is pretty low for Davis. Even if he's a nice bench depth piece who can fill in during byes or injuries, it's not a bad investment of $20. Tony's team was also the worst in the league last year, and the team might need a year or two to build up some talent.
Atwell may prove to be a useful piece in 4 years, so that could hurt. It's also unfortunate that Robinson is on a contract that makes him more of a salary dump than a trade chip for assets.
I like the deal, but it also hurts to see a receiver like Robinson leave, only to get another veteran receiver in return.

### Grade
**Tony: B**  
**Danny: C-** 


Tony doesn't get a ton in return for Robinson, which would really help his rebuild. However, he frees up a ton of salary, so it's a solid move for him.
This grade for Danny really depends on how the rest of his offseason goes, but right now, I think it looks like an uphill battle. He needs to make more moves than this for his team to be able to spend in Free Agency.
He gets the best player in the deal, but he is paying for it.

After I thought I was done writing, we had another trade go down. Dayman & The Nightman moved up 4 spots in the draft in exchange for a couple of WRs.

#### Dayman & The Nightman receive:
| Player | POS | Contract | Yrs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2022 1.10 | - | $105 | 3+1 |

#### RatCats receive:
| Player | POS | Contract | Yrs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2022 2.02 | - | $72 | 3 |
| Cole Beasley | WR | $99 | 1 |
| Kadarius Toney | WR | $5.50 | 1 |

Not only do Nick and Eddie move up four spots here, they also gain a fourth year option on their second selection of the draft.
I think the spot around 10 will have a solid talent available, so the $105 contract shouldn't be too bad.
The team is publicly rebuilding, so flipping two expiring wideouts for a better draft choice with an option year is a solid move in my opinion.
Shedding Cole Beasley's contract is a nice touch, although this team has a lot of roster spots to fill with not a lot of money.

The RatCats were a force to be reckoned with last season, and return a lot of key pieces from that team.
The team does potentially lose Deebo Samuel and Saquon Barkley, so there is some production to be replaced (Barkley sucks, but he's still Saquon Barkley).
With most of the team filled out, I like Zach moving back 4 spots and picking up some cap space that way. If he decides to cut Beasley, those savings are pretty much neutralized, but there's more to the trade than just Beasley.
Zach picks up Kadarius Toney, a very exciting young WR. There's a possibility he ends up outside of New York this season, which could also improve his QB situation.
Toney is expiring, but with a solid year, he could be an RFA candidate, alongside Josh Allen. He's in line to produce at least $60 or $70 of surplus, a huge add to a contending team.

### Grade
**Nick/Eddie: B+**  
**Zach: B** 


Nick and Eddie grade out just a tad bit higher here, because the financial flexibility gained, four draft spots, and fourth year option all trump the value of an expiring Toney for them.
Draft capital is just what a rebuilding team needs, and they got it here, albeit a four spot jump.
Zach picks up a nice piece in Toney, but he does have to take on a Cole Beasley contract that might turn into a cap casualty.
Moving down 4 spots helps a lot more if he retains the financial flexibility attained by that move, but Beasley neutralizes it.
However, I still give a B grade, because the addition of Toney is a solid move that should help this team compete once again.
